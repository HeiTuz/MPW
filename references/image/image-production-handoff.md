# Portable image-production handoff

MPW owns prompt compilation. An image generator owns execution. The boundary between them is `image-production-handoff/v2`, a runtime-neutral JSON object validated by `contracts/v1/image-production-handoff.schema.json`.

## Compile

Create a request with `schema_version: image-production-request/v2`, then run:

```sh
python3 scripts/compile_image_handoff.py request.json --output handoff.json
```

Required request fields:

- `job_id`: portable identifier using letters, digits, `.`, `_`, or `-`.
- `operation`: `generate` or `edit`; edits require at least one input image.
- `subject`: the main image subject.
- `output.filename`: a PNG, JPEG, or WebP basename.

Optional prompt fields are `action`, `scene`, `composition`, `lighting`, `style`, and `text`. Optional execution hints are `negative_prompt`, `aspect_ratio`, `image_size`, and string-valued `metadata`.

`input_images` entries contain only `path` and `role`. The array accepts at most 20 entries, and each path may occur only once regardless of role. Paths must be relative to the handoff bundle or public HTTPS URLs. Absolute paths, home-directory shortcuts, credentials in URLs, and traversal are rejected. Bundle relative assets beside the JSON when moving it between machines.

## Execute

A compatible executor reads the handoff, resolves relative inputs from the handoff bundle, uses `operation` to select generation or edit behavior, and writes the requested output filename. The executor may map `aspect_ratio` and `image_size` to its supported controls, but must reject unsupported required behavior rather than silently changing the request.

ImgGen2 can consume this contract. It is optional: MPW still writes standalone prompts, and the handoff is generic enough for any executor implementing the schema.

## Example request

```json
{
  "schema_version": "image-production-request/v2",
  "job_id": "launch-card-01",
  "operation": "edit",
  "subject": "A product launch card preserving the supplied product and label",
  "scene": "Pale stone surface with soft window light",
  "composition": "Centered product framing",
  "style": "Restrained editorial design",
  "input_images": [
    {"path": "assets/product.png", "role": "Product identity reference"}
  ],
  "aspect_ratio": "4:5",
  "output": {"filename": "launch-card.png"}
}
```
